# Toxic-Comment-Classification
This project trains a deep learning model to detect toxic comments using LSTMs, Bidirectional Layers, and Embeddings. It processes text data, builds a model using TensorFlow and Keras, evaluates performance, and deploys an interactive Gradio interface for real-time predictions.
